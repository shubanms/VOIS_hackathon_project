# Description
This project uses object detection to identify and classify waste detected in the image with the help of image detection in python
and neural networks.

Neural networks are parallel computing devices, 
which are basically an attempt to make a computer model of the brain.
The main objective is to develop a system to perform various computational tasks faster than the traditional systems.

This project is done in python specifically Jupyter notebooks using python modules such as NumPy, MatPlotLib and pyplot, CV2
